# Where can I go

Web application showing flight ticket prices for multiple destinatons at the same time. See http://where2fly2.com

The application has limited access to flight data. It uses the following sources:
*  Transavia flight data exposed by open API - updated daily.
* Google QPX Flight data - queries are limited to the free quota of 50 requests peer day, so the shown prices are not always up to date.

Unfortunaltely, this date is not enough for a good search.

## Build and run

    lein uberjar
    
From REPL, start `wcig.web.start-server`:

    wcig.run=> (use 'wcig.web)
    wcig.run=> (start-server :dev 3002 "localhost" 27017)
